# How does work role hierarchy feature

A role hierarchy allows roles to be organized in a tree-like structure where roles can inherit permissions from other roles. This means that a higher-level role, often called a parent role, can pass down its permissions to lower-level roles, known as child roles. For example, in a corporate environment, a role hierarchy might be set up so that a "Manager" role inherits all the permissions of an "Employee" role, plus additional managerial permissions. This hierarchical structuring simplifies the assignment and management of permissions because changes to a parent role automatically propagate to its child roles, reducing redundancy and the potential for errors. In RootAsRole this is possible by adding the `parent` array in a role definition.
