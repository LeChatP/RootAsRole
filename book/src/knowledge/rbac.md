# Why you need to use Role-Based Access Control Model

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that grants access to resources based on a user's role within an organization. Here are some reasons why you need to use Role-Based Access Control:

1. **Simplified User Management**: RBAC eliminates the need to manage individual user permissions, making it easier to add or remove users from a system.
1. **Increased Efficiency**: RBAC automates the process of granting and revoking access to resources, reducing the administrative burden on IT teams.
1. **Scalability**: RBAC is highly scalable, making it an ideal solution for large and complex organizations.
1. **Flexibility**: RBAC can be applied to various systems, applications, and networks, making it a versatile security solution.
